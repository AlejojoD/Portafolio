PORTFOLIO:
<br>
I've recently created a portfolio showcasing my experience, projects, and about me section using React JS. The portfolio includes details about my professional background, skills, and accomplishments, providing a comprehensive overview of my work. I chose React JS for its flexibility and efficiency in building dynamic web applications, allowing me to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio that highlights my capabilities and achievements.
